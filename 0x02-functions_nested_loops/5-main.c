0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
C
 By: Julien Barbier
 Weight: 1
 Project over - took place from Jul 18, 2023 6:00 AM to Jul 19, 2023 6:00 AM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
In a nutshell…
Auto QA review: 0.0/106 mandatory & 0.0/36 optional
Altogether:  0.0%
Mandatory: 0.0%
Optional: 0.0%
Calculation:  0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%)  == 0.0%
Resources
Read or watch:

Nested while loops
C - Functions
Learning to Program in C (Part 06) (stop at 14:00)
What is the purpose of a function prototype?
C - Header Files (stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
More Info
You do not have to understand the call by reference (address), stack, static variables, recursions or arrays, yet.
